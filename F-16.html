           <p>The General Dynamics (later Lockheed Martin) F-16 Fighting Falcon, introduced in 1978, is a highly versatile fourth-generation multirole fighter known for its agility, compact design, and widespread global use. Powered by a single Pratt & Whitney F100 or General Electric F110 turbofan engine (up to 29,500 lbf with afterburner), it achieves Mach 2.05 (1,353 mph) and is armed with a 20mm M61 Vulcan cannon and up to 17,000 lbs of missiles (e.g., AIM-9 Sidewinder, AIM-120 AMRAAM) or bombs. Over 4,604 units were built across variants like the F-16A (early fighter), F-16C/D (upgraded multirole), and F-16V (advanced with AESA radar). Its fly-by-wire system, bubble canopy, and advanced avionics ensure superior dogfighting and precision strike capabilities. Operated by 25 nations, it saw combat in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Syria, with upgraded versions still active today.</p>
