           <p>The Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21, introduced in 1959, is a Soviet supersonic fighter and interceptor renowned for its delta-wing design and widespread use, earning the nickname "Fishbed." Powered by a Tumansky R-11 or R-25 turbojet (up to 16,535 lbf with afterburner), it reached Mach 2.0 (1,385 mph) and was armed with a 23mm cannon (in some variants) plus missiles like the K-13 (AA-2 Atoll). Over 11,496 units were built across variants like the MiG-21F (early fighter), MiG-21PFM (interceptor), and MiG-21bis (multirole), with roles from air superiority to ground attack. Its agility, simplicity, and low cost made it a mainstay for over 50 air forces, seeing combat in Vietnam, the Middle East, and beyond, with some upgraded versions still in service today.</p>
