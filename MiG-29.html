           <p>The Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-29 Fulcrum, introduced in 1982, is a Soviet (later Russian) fourth-generation jet fighter designed for air superiority with exceptional agility. Powered by two Klimov RD-33 turbofan engines (18,300 lbf each with afterburner), it reaches Mach 2.25 (1,490 mph) and is armed with a 30mm GSh-30-1 cannon and up to six air-to-air missiles (e.g., R-27, R-73). Over 1,600 units were built across variants like the MiG-29A (initial fighter), MiG-29S (multirole with enhanced radar), and MiG-29M (advanced with thrust-vectoring). Its robust design, infrared search-and-track (IRST) system, and maneuverability rivaled Western fighters like the F-16, though limited range and avionics were drawbacks. Exported to over 30 countries, it saw combat in conflicts like the Yugoslav Wars and remains in service with upgrades.</p>
