           <p>The Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15 fagot, a Soviet jet fighter introduced in 1949, was a formidable adversary in the Korean War, challenging U.S. air superiority with its swept-wing design and exceptional performance. Powered by a Klimov VK-1 engine (5,952 lbf), it reached speeds up to 668 mph and was armed with two 23mm cannons and one 37mm cannon, optimized for air-to-air combat. Over 18,000 units were built across variants like the MiG-15 (day fighter), MiG-15bis (improved with better engine and avionics), and MiG-15UTI (two-seat trainer). Its high climb rate and maneuverability at altitude made it a fierce rival to the F-86 Sabre, though it was less effective at lower altitudes. Widely exported to over 40 countries, the MiG-15â€™s robust design and combat effectiveness shaped Cold War air forces, with some remaining in service into the 2000s.</p>
