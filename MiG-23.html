           <p>The Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-23, introduced in 1970, was a Soviet variable-geometry (swing-wing) fighter designed for air superiority and ground attack, notable as the first Soviet jet with look-down/shoot-down radar. Powered by a Tumansky R-29-300 turbojet (27,500 lbf with afterburner), it reached Mach 2.32 (1,553 mph) and carried a 23mm GSh-23L cannon, plus missiles like the R-23 (AA-7 Apex) and R-60 (AA-8 Aphid). Over 5,047 units were built across variants like the MiG-23M (multirole fighter), MiG-23BN (ground attack), and MiG-23MLD (upgraded fighter). Its swing-wing design enhanced versatility, but complex maintenance and reliability issues limited its effectiveness. Exported to over 20 countries, it saw combat in Afghanistan, the Middle East, and Africa, with some air forces using it into the 2000s.</p>
