            <p>The McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II, introduced in 1960, is an iconic American supersonic fighter-bomber renowned for its versatility, serving in air superiority, ground attack, and reconnaissance roles. Powered by two General Electric J79-GE-17 turbojets (17,900 lbf each with afterburner), it reached Mach 2.23 (1,711 mph) and was armed with a 20mm M61 Vulcan cannon (later models) and up to 18,650 lbs of missiles (e.g., AIM-7 Sparrow, AIM-9 Sidewinder) or bombs. Over 5,195 units were built across variants like the F-4B (Navy), F-4E (Air Force with cannon), and F-4G (Wild Weasel). Its powerful radar, speed, and payload made it a mainstay for the U.S. and 11 allied nations, seeing extensive combat in Vietnam, the Middle East, and Desert Storm, with some upgraded versions in service until the 2010s.</p>
