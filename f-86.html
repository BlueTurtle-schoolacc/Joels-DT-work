           <p>The North American F-86 Sabre, a transonic jet fighter introduced in 1949, was a cornerstone of U.S. air power during the Korean War, renowned for its swept-wing design and ability to counter the Soviet MiG-15. Powered by variants of the General Electric J47 engine (up to 5,910 lbf in the F-86F), it featured six .50-cal machine guns (later 20mm cannons in some models) and achieved a top speed of around 695 mph. With over 9,860 units built across variants like the day fighter F-86A/E/F, all-weather F-86D, and fighter-bomber F-86H, it served in multiple roles, including air superiority and ground attack. Its advanced aerodynamics, including an “all-flying tail” in later models, gave it superior maneuverability, securing a 5-6:1 kill ratio against MiGs. The Sabre’s versatility and export to over 30 nations cemented its legacy as the most-produced Western jet fighter, remaining in service until 1994.</p>
