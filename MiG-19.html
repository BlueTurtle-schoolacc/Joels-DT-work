           <p>The Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-19, introduced in 1955, was the Soviet Union's first supersonic fighter, capable of reaching Mach 1.35 (900 mph) and playing a pivotal role in Cold War air forces. Powered by two Tumansky RD-9B turbojets (7,160 lbf each with afterburners), it was armed with three 30mm NR-30 cannons and could carry missiles or bombs. Variants like the MiG-19S (day fighter) and MiG-19PM (missile-armed interceptor) showcased its versatility, with over 2,170 built and thousands more license-produced in China as the Shenyang J-6. Its agile design excelled in close-range dogfights, though its short range and complex maintenance limited its effectiveness compared to later jets. Exported to over 20 countries, the MiG-19 saw combat in Vietnam and the Middle East, remaining in service in some nations until the 2000s.</p>
